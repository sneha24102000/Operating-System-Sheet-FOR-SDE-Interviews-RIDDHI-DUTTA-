Thrashing is a computer activity that makes little or no progress.Usually, this happens either of limited resources or exhaustion of memory.
It arises when a page fault occurs.Page fault arises when memory access of virtual memory space does not map to the content of RAM.

The effect of Thrashing is 
1.CPU becomes idle.
2.Decreasing the utilization increases the degree of multiprogramming and hence bringing more processes at a time which in fact increases the thrashing exponentially.
