Q13. What is a deadlock? (VVI)
 

Ans-Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. 

Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions) 
Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-shareable (Only one process can use at a time) 
Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources. 
No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource. 
Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.
