Bélády’s anomaly is the name given to the phenomenon where increasing the number of page frames results in an increase in the number of page faults for a given memory access pattern.

This phenomenon is commonly experienced in following page replacement algorithms:



First in first out (FIFO)
Second chance algorithm
Random page replacement algorithm
Reason of Belady’s Anomaly –
The other two commonly used page replacement algorithms are Optimal and LRU, but Belady’s Anamoly can never occur in these algorithms for any reference string as they belong to a class of stack based page replacement algorithms.
