Q2. What are the benefits of multithreaded programming? 
Ans-The benefits of multi threaded programming can be broken down into four major categories:

-Responsiveness :–
   Multithreading in an interactive application may allow a program to continue running even if a part of    it is blocked or is performing a lengthy operation, thereby increasing responsiveness to the user.
-Resource Sharing :–
  Processes may share resources only through techniques such as-
  -Message Passing
  -Shared Memory
  Such techniques must be explicitly organized by programmer. However, threads share the memory   and the resources of the process to which they belong by default.
  The benefit of sharing code and data is that it allows an application to have several threads of activity   within same address space.
-Economy :–
   Allocating memory and resources for process creation is a costly job in terms of time and space.
-Scalability –
  The benefits of multi-programming greatly increase in case of multiprocessor architecture, where   threads may be running parallel on multiple processors.
