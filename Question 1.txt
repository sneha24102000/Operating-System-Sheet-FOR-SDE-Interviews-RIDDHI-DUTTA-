Q1. What is the difference between process and thread? 
Ans- Process-
        1.Process means any program is in execution.
        2.Process takes more time to terminate.
        3.It takes more time for creation.
        4.It also takes more time for context switching.
        5.Process is less efficient in term of communication.
        6.Process consume more resources.
        7.Process is isolated.
        8.Process switching uses interface in operating system.
        9.Process has its own Process Control Block, Stack and Address Space.
 
       Thread-
        1.Thread means segment of a process.
        2.Thread takes less time to terminate.
        3.It takes less time for creation.
        4.It takes less time for context switching.
        5.Thread is more efficient in term of communication.
        6.Thread consume less resources.
        7.Threads share memory.
        8.Thread switching does not require to call a operating system and cause an interrupt to            the kernel.
        9.Thread has Parentsâ€™ PCB, its own Thread Control Block and Stack and common Address space.
